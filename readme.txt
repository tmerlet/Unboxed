Hi, Thank you for reviewing my code test! 

I went a little bit over 4 hours, but tried to stick to the time limit as much as possible.  

Part 1 - I chose to use angularJS as this was the language I used in the last project I worked on, but I would also have enjoyed doing this in Ruby.  

Part 2 - I enjoyed trying to implement the design.  I did not try and make it responsive.  

I look forward to hearing from you! 
All the best
